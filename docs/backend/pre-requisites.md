# Pre-requisites

- An AWS account.
- AWS CLI with a profile that has sufficient permissions for CDK deployments.
- A recent version of Rust.
- [cargo-lambda](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/) including zig for cross-compilation.
- Python 3.9+.
- [Poetry 1.4+](https://python-poetry.org/) for infrastructure Python dependencies.
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html).
- A domain name. Raktar will be hosted on a sub-domain, so it's fine to use a domain that's used
for other things as well.
